          The program of the conference will consist of, apart from one Keynote Address and 4 â€“ 6 common Plenary Lectures, two parallel sessions, one in pure branches of Mathematics giving special emphasis on Functional Analysis, Real Analysis, Topology, Topological Dynamical Systems etc. and the other in applied branches of Mathematics with more emphasis on Mathematical Modeling, Non-linear Dynamical Systems and Mathematical Biology. We are looking forward to welcoming you in Jadavpur University.
