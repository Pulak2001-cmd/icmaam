        <h3>Jadavpur University : </h3>
        <p style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>In 1910 the Society for the Promotion of Technical Education in Bengal which looked after Bengal Technical Institute (which later became College of Engineering and Technology, Bengal) was amalgamated to NCE. NCE henceforth looked after the College of Engineering and Technology, Bengal which by 1940 was virtually functioning as a University. The founders believed that the Technology Faculty could not sustain itself without active Faculties of the Basic Sciences and the Humanities. While playing a vital role in technical education in the country, the University may be said to rest on three pillars-Technology, Science and Arts. After Independence, the Government of West Bengal, with the concurrence of the Govt. of India, enacted the necessary legislation to establish Jadavpur University on the 24th of December 1955.</p>
        <p style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>Now the University has been achieved 1st position among all State universities, 4th position in the University Category, 11th position in Engineering, 13th in research, 18th in Pharmacy & 12th position in overall category accorded by NIRF (2022), MHRD Govt. India.</p>
